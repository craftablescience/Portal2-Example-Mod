# Portal2 Example Mod
 A sample mod for Portal 2, to quickly get started.

## Installation
Place the MyMod folder in your steamapps/sourcemods folder. (Go up from the folder containing the Portal 2 folder, and the sourcemods folder is in this folder.) Then, restart Steam. It should be in the list of games now.

## Notes
Maps go into the "maps" folder. Currently, in the chapter menu, "Chapter 1" leads to the map "sp_a1_00". Everything in this mod should be reconfigured anyway, however -- don't just use the placeholder images!
